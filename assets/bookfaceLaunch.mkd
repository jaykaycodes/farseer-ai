# 🎇🪄 Launch Bookface: Farseer.ai - Get csv/json/xlsx from unstructured webpages.

Hey YC fam! 

We built Farseer to let you **ask questions to get structured JSON data from unstructured webpages**. 
### 💍 Example
Whilst on Linkedin you stumble on a potential lead to email later. In Farseer.ai, you have a _"new lead"_ question template.  

	- What is this persons full name?
	- Can you list all the companies where this person worked?
	- Where did this person go to school?
	- Do we know any of the same people?

Running Farseer takes the questions and page content and puts it through a LLM the output is a format, like
```JSON
{
	full_name: "Justin Hilliard",
	companies: "He was a Data Scientist at Sonos and a part of the Product Growth team at Facebook",
	education: "Carnegie Mellon.  Majoring in Computer Science",
	mutual_connects: "4 mutual connections."
}
```

### 🫠 Usecases
- **Affiliate Marketers** - Take product webpages from multiple sources, summarize it and store it in a DB to display on an affiliate site.
