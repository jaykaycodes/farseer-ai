# 🎇🪄 Launch Bookface: Farseer.ai - Use GPT prompts to get and save structured data from webpages.

Hey YC fam! 

With Farseer, create GPT prompts and set an output format, run those prompts on webpages as you do research, export to airtable/json/notion/xlsx/csv.

__🙇‍♂️ Background__ A client needed a similar product, so we built it. The usecase is getting structured data from unstructured webpages, which needed to be _95% accurate_.  A PERFECT ChatGPT usecase.  

### 🫠 Usecases
- **Lists w/ Context** - we've all done hours research, only end up with a list of URLs without any context. Use farseer to save the urls and add a blurb about the page.
- **Lead Generation** - Take LinkedIn profiles, ask common questions about the profiles, send that data to CRM or airtable.
- **Recruiting** - Take LinkedIn profiles, ask common questions about the profiles, send that data to an ATS or airtable.
- **Investing/VC** - Save and summarize company marketing in different lists and questions to those pages.
- **Cataloging** - Take webpages with product information and save them to a common destination.

### ⚙️ How it works
- 📝 Save multiple `output templates`.  These are sets of related prompts with a common output format and destination.
- 🏃‍♂️ Export (airtable/json/notion/xlsx/csv) and Run a prompt on a page whilst browsing.
- 🛠️ Built as a Browser extension compatible with most modern browsers (chrome, safari, firefox).

### 💍 Example
Whilst on Linkedin you stumble on a potential lead to email later. In Farseer.ai, you have a _"new lead"_ question template.  

	- col_name: full_name  		 | prompt: get the persons full name.
	- col_name: companies  		 | prompt: where did this person work?
	- col_name: education  		 | prompt: list the places this person when to school.
	- col_name: mutual_connects  | prompt: Do we know any of the same people?

Running Farseer takes the prompts and page content, puts it through a LLM and outputs...
```JSON
{
	full_name: "Justin Hilliard",
	companies: "He was a Data Scientist at Sonos and a part of the Product Growth team at Facebook",
	education: "Carnegie Mellon.  Majoring in Computer Science",
	mutual_connects: "4 mutual connections."
}
```
